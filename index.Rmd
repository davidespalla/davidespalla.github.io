I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Neuronal Networks for Memory Lab](https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/theme-3-plasticity-memory/research-groups-theme-3/neuronal-networks-memory/) at the [Donders Centre for Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) in Nijmegen (NL), and a fellow of the [Netherlands eScience center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). My work mostly focuses on the developement and applications of Machine Learning tools for the analysis of neural data.
