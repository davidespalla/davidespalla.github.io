I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) in Nijmegen (NL), and a fellow of the [Netherlands eScience center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). 

I have a background in statistical physics and computational neuroscience, and I am working at the [Neuronal Networks for Memory Lab](https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/theme-3-plasticity-memory/research-groups-theme-3/neuronal-networks-memory/), where I am developing and applying machine learning tools for the analysis of neural data.
