Here is a brief summary of the paper, as featured in eLife digest:

"When we recall a past experience, accessing what is known as an ‘episodic memory’, it usually does not appear as a still image or a snapshot of what occurred. Instead, our memories tend to be dynamic: we remember how a sequence of events unfolded, and when we do this, we often re-experience at least part of that same sequence. If the memory includes physical movement, the sequence combines space and time to remember a trajectory. For example, a mouse might remember how it went down a hole and found cheese there.

However, mathematical models of how past experiences are stored in our brains and retrieved when we remember them have so far focused on snapshot memories. ‘Attractor network models’ are one type of mathematical model that neuroscientists use to represent how neurons communicate with each other to store memories. These models can provide insights into how circuits of neurons, for example those in the hippocampus (a part of the brain crucial for memory), may have evolved to remember the past, but so far they have only focused on how single moments, rather than sequences of events, are represented by populations of neurons.

Spalla et al. found a way to extend these models, so they could analyse how networks of neurons can store and retrieve dynamic memories. These memories are represented in the brain as ‘continuous attractors’, which can be thought of as arrows that attract mental trajectories first to the arrow itself, and once on the arrow, to the arrowhead. Each recalled event elicits the next one on the arrow, as the mental trajectory advances towards the arrowhead. Spalla et al. determined that memory networks in the hippocampus of mammals can store large numbers of these ‘arrows’, up to the same amount of ‘snapshot’ memories predicted to be stored with similar models.

Spalla et al.’s results may allow researchers to better understand memory storage and recall, since they allow for the modelling of complex and realistic aspects of episodic memories. This could provide insights into processes such as why our minds wander, as well as having implications for the study of how neurons physically interact with each other to transmit information."
