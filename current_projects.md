Here you can find a brief description of the main projects I am working on at the moment. 

## Neural population coding of space and objects in the hippocampus

I am working with Matteo Guardamagna on elettrophysiological data he collected from the hippocampus of mice exploring arenas populated with different objects. 
Since mice were not food deprived and free to explore at their will, this paradigms affords an interesting opportunity to investigate neural activity during spontaneous behaviour.
We developed a behaviour segmentation pipeline to extract exploratory periods and other behavioural states from the videos of the exploratory sessions, and we are using the output of this pipeline to investigate how the hippocampus represents familiar and novel objects during unconstrained exploration.

## Cortical dynamics during associative learning

I am working with Rafael Pedrosa on a dataset he collected using voltage sensitive imaging to record the cortical activity of mice.
Mice were subjected to a trace conditioning protocol, in which they learned to associate an auditory stimulus to the delivery of a reward after a waiting period. During the learning sessions, the whole right cortical hemisphere was recorded, together with the local field potential in the hippocampus.
We are using population-wide analysis techniques and machine learning tools on this extensive datasets to investigate how cortical dynamics is shaped by learning, and how it interacts with the hippocampus during the process.

## Sharp wave ripple interactions with brain oscillations

I am working on electrophysiological recordings collected by Matteo Guardamagna from the CA1 regions of mice during navigational behaviour and sleep. We are investigating how hippocampal sharp wave ripples interact with the various oscillatory modes present during sleep and locomotion, and how these interaction relate to memory consolidation.
